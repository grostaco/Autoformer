# Autoformer
A simpler, opinionated, and documented [autoformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13008) adjustment of the [official](https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer) code repository.

The official autoformer repository lacks comprehensive documentation and is littered with code for other architectures for benchmarking purposes. The goal of this repository is to serve as a good starting point for learning the autoformer architecture.

Code within the official autoformer repository is more complex than it needed to be. This implementation strips out a lot of options and modules that are not required for the autoformer architecture in order to streamline the process of learning the architecture.
